# Fritzing parts

## Parts
* TSSOP-24 part file (.fzp) and PCB image in SVG format. It uses Fritzing's own breadbroad and schematic images for SSOP-24 packaging. So, I didn't duplicate them. Also note that I think the TSSOP-20 part that comes with Fritzing has a small flaw: the pitch is too big. According to my analysis to the PCB SVG image, the pitch is about 0.6603333333334 mm, which is much larger than 0.65 mm standard -- at least not [TI's](ttp://www.ti.com/lit/ml/mpds363/mpds363.pdf)
